### Term Project Overview
Throughout this semester, each student will participate in a team-based term paper project. Teams will consist of no more than three students. Depending on your interest, you can pick one of the following project types described below.

In general, your term paper must contain several essential elements: data, results and a contribution, all of which go together to address one or more research questions or goals. Results are obtained by applying some analytic process to the data, and the contribution is the unique perspective or conclusion supported by the results. The kinds of data collected and the methodology used to produce results are highly dependent on the type of research being conducted. Typically, the research process begins with a desired contribution (e.g., improve user security practices) and one or more specific research questions (e.g., can awareness method X improve user security practice Y?). The specific type of research conducted will then depend on what has to be done to answer the research question(s) or address the research goal(s).

## Project Expectations
For this course, you are free to engage in any research project, for which all of the following apply:

- You have a specific research question/goal
- You have a feasible plan for obtaining data and results
- You can identify an expected contribution that is security-related

These are communicated as part of your proposal. Additional requirements are described below.

Note:
Any research involving the use of human subjects (e.g. interviews, surveys, etc) must be cleared through the PSU Institutional Review Board (IRB) human subjects research review process. This process requires an application be submitted to the IRB specifying details of the proposed research and IRB training for all researchers. Only approved applications are permitted to proceed with data collection. If you wish to pursue this process, fully review the IRB requirements, plan your research in detail and contact your instructor very early in the semester (before the proposal is due) regarding your plans.

## Resources
The following resources are available to you at no additional cost:

- PSU Webapps Links to an external site.: Web-based versions of various applications including Mathematica, Matlab, Minitab and Microsoft Office
- The extensive PSU library system.
- Zotero, free bibliographic software that integrates with MS Word and Firefox. You are strongly encouraged to use bibliographic software, such as Zotero. There are various Zotero tutorials available; here is a short introductory walkthrough. to help you get started.

## Format
Your project manuscript must be in IEEE format as if you were submitting your paper for publication. A Word-based manuscript template is available as part of the guide to the IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

Note: MS Word (.docx) is the expected file format for your deliverables (note that PSU provides you access to MS Word through Webapps). If you prefer to submit an alternate file format, contact your instructor.

## Project Types
While you are free to engage in any project meeting the above considerations, there are several general categories of research projects for you to consider which can be distinguished in terms of their data, goals, and methods.

## Project Type | Description | Nature of Contribution
# Survey Paper	
A literature survey (or review) is a type of paper where the data consists of other papers that are all concerned with a particular common topic. The analytic process applied is one of categorization, classification, summarization, and the results consist of an organized review of the data that conveys the important ideas, controversies and directions in the topic area in an easy-to-understand manner (e.g. discussion of strengths and limitations of a set of reviewed techniques).

Example:
Classify state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques for detecting denial-of-service attacks and provide their pros and cons.
The contribution here is some unique perspective or conclusion(s) drawn from the results. For example, you might discuss the limitations of the surveyed techniques and propose a potential new technique that could address one or more limitations

# Descriptive Study	
This option has data drawn from two sources. The first source is published papers, as in the survey. The second data is an empirical collection effort conducted by the student where the data in some way describes the primary phenomenon of the study.

Example: Review a set of anti-anonymization techniques and analyze a large sample of web pages for evidence of the techniques being employed in the wild; report statistics describing results.

As with the survey, the contribution here is a unique perspective or conclusion(s) drawn from the results which in this case are also based on your empirical data.

# Demonstration	
This option is a working demonstration of your choice which demonstrates a significant information security and assurance concept. Talk to me if you plan the go in this direction. I will provide the code (Python), technical help,  and the data set for this type of project. You can skip two hands-on labs if you prefer this project.

Example:
Creating an interactive Power BI Dashboard for a security data set.
Build a machine-learning algorithm to detect phishing websites in Python and study its performance.
The contribution here is some unique perspective or conclusion(s) drawn from the results and illustrated by your demonstration.

# Other	
This option is intended for ideas that do not fit in any of the above categories. Any project idea meeting the criteria discussed above is satisfactory.	The nature of the contribution here is project-dependent.
